*   there are total 5 pages in this project including the home page. Now for starters, first we need to link all the view pages with the link.
    that can be done by adding "requestMapping" annotation.
    
*	To link a single view page with multiple urls, pass an array of the context path in params:
	Eg.: @RequestMapping({"/", "/home"})   
	
*	now once the user submits the job details in "addjob" page, he gets directed to the success page displaying the entries. So, we need to have
	POJO class in the model folder containing all the variables in the "addjob" page. 
	SO we are using "lombok" dependency as it :
	Lombok dependency is used to reduce boilerplate code in Java by providing annotations that automatically generate common code like getters, 
	setters, constructors, and more at compile time.
	
	Mention "@Data" annotation to make lombok understand which class is POJO class.
	Further can add "@AllArgsConstructor" to add the constructor as well.
	
	Eg: 
	@Data
	@NoArgsConstructor
	@AllArgsConstructor
	@Component
	public class JobPost { .... }
